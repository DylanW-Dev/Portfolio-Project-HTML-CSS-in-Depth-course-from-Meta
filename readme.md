## 📌 About the Project

This project was created as part of the **Portfolio Project – HTML & CSS in Depth** course from Meta.  
The goal was to design and build a professional, responsive homepage for a fictional business using the core web-development principles taught throughout the course.

For this project, I selected the fictional luxury jewellery brand **Mangata & Gallo**, known for elegant, handcrafted designs made for special occasions such as engagements, weddings, and anniversaries.

The assignment emphasized:

- Visual layout  
- Semantic HTML structure  
- CSS layout techniques (Grid & Flexbox)  
- Styling tailored to a specific target audience  
- Interactivity using pseudo-classes and CSS effects  

This homepage embodies the brand’s aesthetic: **luxurious, elegant, modern, and timeless**.
