Mangata & Gallo – Portfolio Project

A luxury jewellery homepage built with semantic HTML, responsive CSS (Grid + Flexbox), and enhanced interactivity.

📌 About the Project

This project was created as part of the Portfolio Project – HTML & CSS in Depth course from Meta.
The goal was to design and build a professional, responsive home page for a fictional business using the core web-development principles taught throughout the course.

	•	Visual layout
	•	Semantic HTML structure
	•	CSS layout techniques (Grid / Flexbox)
